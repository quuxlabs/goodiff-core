GooDiff is a consumer-oriented service for keeping track of changes of
important documents – and indirectly the services described by these documents
– provided by selected Internet service providers. Our “mission” is to increase
transparency for end consumers such as you and I.

GooDiff is released under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) version
3. The GooDiff software is a work-in-progress separated in various modules to
provide an unique way to track documents on the Internet.

The module is called : goodiff-core

== Description ==

goodiff-core is the software module for fetching, processing and storing the
retrieved web pages.

The configuration is located in ./config/goodiffmonitor.ini
and the monitored services are defined in ./config/providers.xml .

Don't forget to create two Subversion repositories :

- One for the HTML source of the web pages fetched and
- One for the text version of the HTML document.
 
== Requirements ==
